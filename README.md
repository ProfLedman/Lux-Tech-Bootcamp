# Lux Tech Bootcamp - Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my **Lux Tech Bootcamp** repository! This is where I will be posting tasks, projects, and code as I progress through the bootcamp.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the tasks and projects from the **Lux Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp**. The code and projects presented here are not limited to what is being taught during the bootcamp. For each lesson and task assigned, I aim to go above and beyond, exploring more intricate concepts and functionalities within the tools and technologies covered.

While the bootcamp provides a solid foundation, I leverage my existing knowledge and experience to dive deeper into the topics, often extending my work beyond the course requirements. This includes exploring advanced SQL queries, additional data manipulation techniques, and more advanced analytical methods, ensuring that I gain a comprehensive understanding of the tools at hand.

## Technologies

Throughout this bootcamp, I will be working with a range of data analytics tools and technologies. Below is a list of the core software being used, along with additional tools that I am exploring independently:

- **SQL**: For querying, manipulating, and analyzing data in relational databases.
- **Python**: For data analysis, machine learning, and automation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation in Python.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards.
- **Excel**: For basic data analysis and reporting.

## Going Beyond the Curriculum

In addition to the tasks assigned during the bootcamp, I will:

- Apply real-world scenarios and datasets to enhance my learning.
- Implement more complex SQL queries (e.g., window functions, CTEs, subqueries) where applicable.
- Explore optimization techniques and best practices for writing efficient SQL and Python code.
- Work on additional projects outside the core curriculum to strengthen my skills in data visualization, machine learning, and reporting.

## Contributions

This repository is a reflection of my personal learning journey. While contributions are not expected, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas from others interested in data analytics.
